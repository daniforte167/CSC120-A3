Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted with Vivian Wei and Jillian Lehosky.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I went to Thursday morning office hours with Professor Crouser!
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I don't like it. It just feels very extra and I liked the straight forwardness of Python better.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Even if there are differences in the methods or functions used, they still seem to follow a similar structure of gather the information, organize that information, call whatever information is needed, and complete whatever function or method is necessary for the program, and print the result that is requested. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Definitely give yourself time to really work out the issues. There were a few times where I would just get "error" or wouldn't get any message at all but it wasn't working the wy it should and I couldn't figure it out why. I needed to re-look at it and go over it several times before it started to work properly. Working with other students definitely helps and I would recommend doing it more, because having very few collaborating times isn't helpful!
